# Kodak Photo CD Photo Sampler

These are images derived from the Kodak Photo CD Photo Sampler, which contains images that are free to use for any purpose associated with electronic imaging. See `RIGHTS.USE` for full details. 

PNG were downloaded from https://www.cs.albany.edu/~xypan/research/snr/Kodak.html which attributes http://r0k.us/graphics/kodak/. Of note is this disclaimer:  
```
The imagery with which I began was not in PhotoCD format, but 24-bit Sun Raster. 
For a year this page had a link to the source ftp address at Rensellaer Polytechnic Institute. 
When Rensellaer stopped their ftp distribution, I removed the link.  
My conversion into PNG was lossless; the original conversion from PhotoCD was not, nor could it be.  
"Lossless" on this page is used in comparison to what a GIF or JPEG conversion would have done to the data."
```
BMP, TIFF, PCB were downloaded from: https://www.math.purdue.edu/%7Elucier/PHOTO_CD/. See `README.txt` for full details. 
```
(a) BMP_IMAGES --- from
    http://scien.stanford.edu/pages/labsite/scien_test_images_videos.php
    These images were probably converted from PCD by Photoshop.
(b) D65_TIFF_IMAGES --- converted by the program pcdtoppm
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcdtoppm/
    with a D65 white point, then converted to TIFF using pnmtotiff
(c) D65_GREY_TIFF_IMAGES --- converted by pcdtoppm with D65 white point
    and greyscale output
