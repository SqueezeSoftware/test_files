# Kodak Photo CD

These are images derrived from the Kodak Photo CD Photo Sampler, which contains images that are free to use for any purpose associated with electronic imaging. See `RIGHTS.USE` for full details. 

PNG were downloaded from https://www.cs.albany.edu/~xypan/research/snr/Kodak.html which attributes http://r0k.us/graphics/kodak/. 

Of note is this disclaimer:  
```
The imagery with which I began was not in PhotoCD format, but 24-bit Sun Raster. 
For a year this page had a link to the source ftp address at Rensellaer Polytechnic Institute. 
When Rensellaer stopped their ftp distribution, I removed the link.  
My conversion into PNG was lossless; the original conversion from PhotoCD was not, nor could it be.  
"Lossless" on this page is used in comparison to what a GIF or JPEG conversion would have done to the data."

BMP, TIFF, PCB wer downloaded from: https://www.math.purdue.edu/%7Elucier/PHOTO_CD/. See `README.txt` for full details.

    http://scien.stanford.edu/pages/labsite/scien_test_images_videos.php
    These images were probably converted from PCD by Photoshop.

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcdtoppm/
    with a D65 white point, then converted to TIFF using pnmtotiff
